The method below has two parameters:img and noise. Img represents a 2D array with the color values of all the pixels, and noise represents the percent of the image array that will have salt and pepper noise. We will add salt pepper noise by having a separate array that is a copy of the original image array which later we will modify to have salt and pepper noise, and then have another variable that represents a 2D array with the same size as the image array that has a bunch of values between $0$ and $1$. Also, we will have salt and pepper variables which we defined as each variable being one half of the noise array. Last but not least, we want a certain percentage of the image and in this case the percentage we want is defined by the noise parameter to have noise so for example if noise is $.05$ then we want $2.5$ percent of the image array to be salt and $2.5$ percent of the image array to have pepper.

    "<p>Now that salt and pepper noise has been added, we want to find a way to reduce as much salt and pepper noise as possible. One of the ways is using the mean filter. What the mean filter does is get a x by y grid situated around a pixel, and then take the mean of all the pixel values in the grid and set the pixel value to that mean value. The method below will demonstrate that by first having two parameters img which represents the image array and s which represents the size of the grid we want. For example, if s is $3$ then we want a $3x3$ grid surrounding a pixel. In order to get that s by s grid first we need a variable that represents a copy of the original image array and then we want to loop through every row and column of the image which we will do by a nested for loop;i in this case represents a row and j in this case represents a column. Inside the nested for loop we are making a grid by getting a slice of the row before the current row and the row that will make it s amount of rows and the same will go for the columns. For example, if we are starting at the second row and we want a $3x3$ grid then we will start at the second row and end at the fourth row, and if we are starting from the second column then we would want to end at the fourth column so we could make it a 3 by 3 grid. Finally, we will get that grid and take the mean of all the color values of the grid and set the pixel value which is described as $F[i,j]$ to that mean value and do this for every pixel in the image. Last but not least, we will return the modified image.</p>\n"

To add, it is more taxing on the eyes to try and look at the image than with one with less noise or virtually no noise. Lastly, we came up with our own filter which we called the range filter and what this filter does it take the range of the grid for a pixel and this range filter is less efficient than the median and mean filter. The range filter made the image become enclosed with white  and also demonstrated how anomalies in an image and dataset could completely change an outcome and why the median filter works the best as it gets rids of skewed color values.</p>\n"

    "<p>In conclusion, an image noise is a random distortion in the color or brightness of an image. The type of noise that was explored today is salt and pepper noise which is when random pixels of image are completely black or white. Our goal in the project was to reduce the amount of salt and pepper tools using noise reduction filters such as mean and median filters and an additional filter that was made on the spot which was the range filter. From the mean, median, and range filters we were able to see a few things:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>When more noise is added to an image the image becomes more grainy </li>\n",
    "<li>As the parameter s for the filters increases the more closer the modified image with noise reduction from the filters gets to the original image.</li>\n",
    "<li>The most efficient filter is the median filter as it ignores anomalies and gets the most useful details of the image.</li>\n",

    "<p>The mean and median filters are premier noise reduction techniques in image processing and are used to make images as clear as possible.</p>\n"
